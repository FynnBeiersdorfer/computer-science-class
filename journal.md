So today I informed myself about prompts. As I understood prompts are pieces of texts that you can give to a computer based model, that is able to answer, examine or explain that piece of text or the command you gave it. It seems like the section teaches me about how to work with these kind of tools. I also informed myself about what a Software Architect does. It seems like you build different code based applications on a different level to reach a final product. This can be performed in a team or alone. The basic skills as a Software Architect are simple coding, documentation, communicationj and some more. This field allows me to create my own applications or finish them for clients or work in a team of Software Architects.

Today we started learning to code. Herefor I signed up on CodeHS and started the program. I learned about what the course will bring me in my career and as a beginner of programing. Then I had to take a kind of test to understand on how good I am in programing and what value I expect from that class for me. After that I learned about Tracy the turtle. i learned how to move her forward and how to draw cricles with her, after that combined I was able to draw a slinky with Tracy.
# August - 22 - 2023
So today I started and went on with learning about Tracy. I learned that she lives in a 400 by 400 pixelworld where I can move her around with different commands. I learned that there is a command that let's her not draw a line while moving. It's called penup() and to let her draw a line again I needed to use the command pendown(). With that knowledge I was able to draw a caterpillar, that consists of 5 circles, in her world. After that I learned how to turn Tracy about any angle I want to to create rectangles, squares and columns in combination with the penup() commands. So today I completed lesson 2.2 and 2.3.
# August - 23 - 2023
In this lesson I went on working with Tracy. I learned how to loop commands for a certain amount of times. This took me a longer time because I was stuck on some little mistakes in my code, so I had to search them for about half an hour. After that I was able to use the for i in range (): command correctly. In the exercise I had to draw the columns from the lesson before with the specific loop command and after some tries I did it.
# August - 24 - 2023
In this lessojn I learned how to turn Tracy about angles that are not exact 90 degrees to create different shapes like a asterik. After that I learned how to use the setposition() command, so I don't have to write commands, to move her to a certain position, that are longer than 1 line. I also learned about the speed() command, it lets Tracy simply move faster, so I don't have to wait too long for her to complete a run. After that I was able to draw a cricle pyramid in combination with the speed(), setpsoition(), left() or right() and loop command.
# August - 25 - 2023
Today I learned how to write In-line comments or multiple line comments to leave a message for everyone that looks in to my code. It's purpose is to tell the people what the code does or important notes for the reader. After that i learned how to name Guidelines correctly. Also I learned how to create functions to make my code shorter,after that I had to draw a pearl bracelet with Tracy on the canvas using the command.
# August - 28 - 2023
In todays class I completed lesson 2.8 on codeHS by completing the last task. For that I had to draw a stack of squares and circles, from the bottom to the top of the canvas, by using functions. After that I started lesson 2.9, here I learned about the color(""), pensize(), begin/end fill() command and the command for the different options of editing a circle. In the exercises I had to use all the commands in combination with functions. There I had to draw four fifferent colored triangles, the bead bracelet in different colors and a kids toy. And then I completed lesson 2.9.
# August - 29 - 2023
Today I started with lesson 2.10 on CodeHS, there I learned about Top Down Design. It is a coding startegy where you basically break down the big problem of a exercise into smaller problems before you start coding. After that think how you could solve every different problem in your code and how to make it as short as possible with the help of for loops or/and functions. After that I had to use that technique in the exercise after that to create highlights for 10 rows of 10 circles and how to create a pathway at each side of the canvas with tracy.
# August - 30 - 2023 
Today I completed lesson 2.11 on CodeHS. Here I learned about variables. They can be used to define different amounts of numbers for radius, length etc. It was a bit hard to understand first, but I got used to it after. After that I had to complet an exercise where I should draw a dartboard onto the canvas with incrasing radius od the circle. And in the final exercise I had to draw 5 squares with increasing side lengths. I was a little bit confused when it didn't work how I first wanted it, but with a little bit of help I understood my mistake.
# August - 31 - 2023
Today I completed lesson 2.12 and 2.13 on CodeHS. Here I learned about user input, to make my code userfriendly and the user is able to choose different sizes od every different function. I also learned about Parameters to use in functions. It is used to make our code shorter by being able to let funtions differ depending on what you write in the parenthesis after the function name.
# September - 1 - 2023
Today I learned how to have further control with the i in for loops. Otherwise I don't have a good day and didn't got much work done and didn't really understand either.
# September - 5 - 2023
Today I started by understanding the stuff I didn't last lesson, then I completed lesson 2.15 on CodeHS and kind of understood how to have further control with the value of i. Then I learned about if statements and hwo they help to skip certain parts in the code if they are not true based on the if statement. I completetd lesson 2.16 except the last exercise.
# September - 6 - 2023
I finally completed the last exercise of lesson 2.16, with a littlie help.
# September - 7 - 2023
In this class I started and completed lesson 2.17 on CodeHS, here I learned more about if/elif/else statements to control the different options in my code. It is also used to make user input more comfortable, by having dofferent optionsfor the user.
# September - 8 - 2023
Today I learned about while loops in lesson 2.18 on CodeHS. While loops help to repeat a code unlimited times until the statement becomes true, after it becomes true it will execute the given command after the while loop. I completed lesson 2.18 on CodeHS.
# September - 11 - 2023
Today I started lesson 2.19 on CodeHS, here I had a summary about everything I learned so far and I learned about the clear() command. After that I tried the first exercise, but had problems at first with it. After I decided to finish that exercise tomorrow.
# September - 12 - 2023
In this class I finished the first and the second exercise on CodeHS lesson 2.19. I struggle a bit at th elast exercise, which I am going to end tomorrow and so finish the turtle part ojn CodeHS.
# September - 13 - 2023
I successfully completed the Tracy Module on CodeHS!
# September - 14 - 2023
In this lesson I started with the real python coding on CodeHS. In the first module I learned the print("") code with which I can print simple text to the display. In the next module I learned about the variables in python and how they were used. I also learned how to find out the class of a variable. I completed modules 3.1 and 3.2.
# September - 20 - 2023
In this class period I started and completed lesson 3.3 on codeHS. I learned how to use user input in my code to make it interactive for the user. It's exactly the same concept like the Tracy codes, so I have no problem using it.
